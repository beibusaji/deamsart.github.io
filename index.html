    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am an Information Technology student with a passion for web design, game development, and creative design. I love bringing ideas to life through technology, whether it's building interactive websites, developing engaging games, or crafting visually stunning designs. Outside of my studies, I enjoy expressing myself through art, exploring new technologies, and constantly challenging myself with new projects. I believe in continuous learning and personal growth, and I am always eager to explore new possibilities in the tech world.</p>
